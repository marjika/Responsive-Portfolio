                <p>I am excited to use my experience in web programming 
                    to help your company present a beautiful face to the online world. With experience in HTML,
                CSS, Javascript, object-oriented programming, and APIs, I have a solid foundation of knowledge 
                that will help your company improve your web presence.</p>
                <P>A number of years ago, I earned a bachelorâ€™s degree in Physics teaching, but in the past 
                    couple of years I have turned my study toward web programming. The more I learn, the more 
                    I find that there are many aspects of web programming.  The workplace environment would 
                    help me channel my knowledge and study into specific and useful goals, both for me and 
                    for my employer.  I am confident in my ability to learn, work hard, and solve problems.</P>
                <p>Throughout my adult life, I have volunteered in a variety of ways, teaching both adults 
                    and children, organizing activities and music groups, and directing and working with 
                    small and large groups.  These experiences have helped me develop an abundance of 
                    problem-solving, organizational, and interpersonal skills that make me a valuable employee.</p>
